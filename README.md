# Used Car Regression Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a regression model to predict used car prices. The model leverages Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor to analyze and predict prices based on input features.

## Steps

- **Preprocessing**: Includes splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables and creates new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Feature Selection**: Includes selecting the main features for the regression.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes  `LinearRegression` and `RandomForestRegressor` from Scikit-learn for training.
- **Prediction**: Generates predictions for car prices.
- **Evaluation**: Calculates metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, make sure the following are installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib (if applicable for visualization)
  - scikit-learn

To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
